# WebRTC Development Platform

A comprehensive WebRTC-based real-time communication platform built with SIP.js and FreeSWITCH.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This project provides a complete solution for implementing WebRTC calling capabilities in web applications using SIP.js for client-side signaling and FreeSWITCH as the media server.
